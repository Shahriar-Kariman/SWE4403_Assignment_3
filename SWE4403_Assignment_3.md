## Quality Attributes

For this assignment I chose usability, reliability and modifiability quality attributes to discuss. Here is why each of those quality attributes are important:

- Usability: In general everyone prefers the use of products to require minimal cognitive load. I don't think there is much more to explain about why usability is important.
- Reliability: Especially when the task is particularly computationaly heavy a system needs to be able allocate resources efficiently in a way that the program is not prone to crashes.
- Modifiability: Applications are generally prefered to be extendable/modifiable since the requirments for tasks may change over time and sometimes particualr users need specific things that maybe unique to them in such cases users need to have an option to develope plugins that work seamlessly with the system.

## Open Source Project Example

A prime example of a great open source project in my opinion would be Belnder a 3D computer graphics tool that can be used for a veriaty of different things visual effects, art, game asset generation, 3D printing models and much more.

Lets assess some of the quality attributes of Blender.

### Usability

With topics as complex as 3D graphics it can be quite challenging to fit all functionalities in a user friendly interface but Blender contributors have mannaged it quite well, while there is still some learning curve with this tool
it is far easier to learn than all other paid alternatives of course this is just my personal opinion.

Part of this succes is due to community support and extensive documentation but they also have special features allowing users to customize its UI and change the hot keys as they prefer and another thing to mention is the geometry
node system that makes it very easy for none technical users to implement complex procedures without writing a single line of code.

### Reliability

### Modifiability
